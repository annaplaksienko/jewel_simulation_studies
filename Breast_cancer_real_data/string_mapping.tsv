Isoform 4 is unable to transduce prolactin signaling. Isoform 6 is unable to transduce prolactin signaling
891	NOTCH4	9606.ENSP00000364163	NOTCH4	Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 4; Functions as a receptor for membrane-bound ligands Jagged1, Jagged2 and Delta1 to regulate cell-fate determination. Upon ligand activation through the released notch intracellular domain (NICD) it forms a transcriptional activator complex with RBPJ/RBPSUH and activates genes of the enhancer of split locus. Affects the implementation of differentiation, proliferation and apoptotic programs. May regulate branching morphogenesis in the developing vascular system (By similarity); Ankyrin repeat domain containing
892	VCAM1	9606.ENSP00000294728	VCAM1	Vascular cell adhesion protein 1; Important in cell-cell recognition. Appears to function in leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. Interacts with integrin alpha-4/beta-1 (ITGA4/ITGB1) on leukocytes, and mediates both adhesion and signal transduction. The VCAM1/ITGA4/ITGB1 interaction may play a pathophysiologic role both in immune responses and in leukocyte emigration to sites of inflammation; C2-set domain containing
893	IFNA1	9606.ENSP00000276927	IFNA1	Interferon alpha-1/13; Produced by macrophages, IFN-alpha have antiviral activities. Interferon stimulates the production of two enzymes: a protein kinase and an oligoadenylate synthetase; Belongs to the alpha/beta interferon family
894	HHIP	9606.ENSP00000296575	HHIP	Hedgehog-interacting protein; Modulates hedgehog signaling in several cell types including brain and lung through direct interaction with members of the hedgehog family
895	HEY2	9606.ENSP00000357348	HEY2	Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 2; Downstream effector of Notch signaling which may be required for cardiovascular development. Transcriptional repressor which binds preferentially to the canonical E box sequence 5'- CACGTG-3'. Represses transcription by the cardiac transcriptional activators GATA4 and GATA6; Belongs to the HEY family
896	CXXC4	9606.ENSP00000378248	CXXC4	CXXC-type zinc finger protein 4; Acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway via its interaction with DVL1; Zinc fingers CXXC-type
897	IL2RB	9606.ENSP00000216223	IL2RB	Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta; Receptor for interleukin-2. This beta subunit is involved in receptor mediated endocytosis and transduces the mitogenic signals of IL2; Belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Type 4 subfamily
898	PDGFC	9606.ENSP00000422464	PDGFC	Platelet-derived growth factor C; Growth factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, survival and chemotaxis. Potent mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin. Required for normal skeleton formation during embryonic development, especially for normal development of the craniofacial skeleton and for normal development of the palate. Required for normal skin morphogenesis during embryonic development. Plays an important role in wound healing, where it appears to be involved in three stages: inflamma [...] 
899	LSDP5	9606.ENSP00000371272	PLIN5	Perilipin-5; Lipid droplet-associated protein that maintains the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis and also regulates fatty acid oxidation in oxidative tissues. Recruits mitochondria to the surface of lipid droplets and is involved in lipid droplet homeostasis by regulating both the storage of fatty acids in the form of triglycerides and the release of fatty acids for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In lipid droplet triacylglycerol hydrolysis, plays a role as a scaffolding protein for three major key lipolytic players: ABHD5, PNPLA2 and LIPE. Reduces the triacylglycerol hyd [...]
